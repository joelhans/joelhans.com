**For fun, I write fiction. Mostly in the form of fairy tales.**

Some of those works have been featured in _West Branch_, _No Tokens_, _Puerto
del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit Journal_, _The Masters Review_,
_Caketrain_, and others. I maintain a [list](/fiction) of all these publications
if
you'd like to take a look.

I received my MFA in creative writing from the University of Arizona in 2016 and
served as the prose &amp; managing editor of [*Fairy Tale
Review*](https://fairytalereview.com) from 2014 to 2018.

I'm currently working on a novel about mythology, fatherhood, constellations,
light pollution, and the lengths to which we might go to rewrite our own
stories.

My work was listed as an honorable mention in the *Caketrain* Competition and
the Madeline P. Plonsker Emerging Writers Residency Prize judged by Brian
Evenson, nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net, and the recipient
of the University of Arizona Foundation Award.

Day to day, I'm a senior developer educator for [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/),
where I write about things like networking, developer productivity, platform
engineering, and anything at the pointy end of cloud native/Kubernetes.

When not working, I spend as much time as I can with my daughters, mountain
bike, play guitar, do calisthenics, and walk around my backyard barefoot.
There's also running, web development, knowledge graphs, gardening, and a few
other interests&mdash;hopefully I'll [write about](/articles/) each of them someday.
