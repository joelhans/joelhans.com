**For fun, I write fiction. Mostly in the form of fairy tales.**

Some of those works have been featured in _West Branch_, _No Tokens_, _Puerto del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit
Journal_, _The Masters Review_, _Caketrain_, and others. I maintain a [list](/fiction) of all these publications if
you'd like to take a look.

I received my MFA in creative writing from the University of Arizona in 2016 and served as the prose &amp; managing
editor of [*Fairy Tale Review*](https://fairytalereview.com) from 2014 to 2018.

I'm currently working on a novel about mythology, fatherhood, constellations, light pollution, and the lengths to which
we might go to rewrite our own stories.

My work was listed as an honorable mention in the *Caketrain* Competition and the Madeline P. Plonsker Emerging Writers
Residency Prize judged by Brian Evenson, nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net, and the recipient of the
University of Arizona Foundation Award.

Day to day, I'm a [freelance content and copywriter](https://commitcopy.com) for open source and cloud native
organizations like CNCF, Kubeshop, and Radicle. I'm mostly interested in developer education &amp; marketing,
documentation, and working on projects at the pointy end of cloud native/Kubernetes.

When not working, I spend as much time as I can with my daughters, mountain bike, play guitar, do calisthenics, and walk
around my backyard barefoot. There's also running, web development, knowledge graphs, gardening, and a few other
interests&mdash;hopefully [write about](/articles/) each of them someday.
