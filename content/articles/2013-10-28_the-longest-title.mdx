I was on vacation for some time and neglected to put up a post about a piece of mine, [“If You Look Long Enough You See
That Everything Is A-Passing,”](https://viewer.joomag.com/psychopomp-magazine-fall-2013/0768091001380984003) has been
featured in the first issue of Psychopomp Magazine. They’re working in the surrealism/slipstream/fabulism space, so I’m
really looking forward to seeing what else they come up with.

More than anything, I’m really excited to be published among two writers I enjoy and admire a great deal: Anne Valente
and Brian Oliu. It’s quite the honor.

So, [go read my story about a girl falling in love amid the moon’s slow
disappearance](https://viewer.joomag.com/psychopomp-magazine-fall-2013/0768091001380984003), and then read the rest of
the great work.
