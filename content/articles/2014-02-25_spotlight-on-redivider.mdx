The always-wonderful litmag Redivider is [in the spotlight on Writer’s
Relief](https://writersrelief.com/2014/02/19/lit-mag-spotlight-redivider/). The Q&A covers some of the basics of what
they do, what they like and what they don’t.

When I originally saw the piece last week, I somehow missed out on them giving my story “Subsoil” a bit of a shout out.

> Joel Hans’ dystopian short story “Subsoil” will really get under your skin. It’s creepy in the best ways.

Thanks so much to Lauren Kay Halloran, Dymon Lewis, and all the other editors at Redivider who made all this happen.
It’s just so incredibly thrilling.
