My story, &ldquo;The Princess on the Glass Hill Becoming,&rdquo; will be published with [_Crow & Cross
Keys_](https://crowcrosskeys.com/) later this year—probably around December. It's a loose retelling of "[The Princess on
the Glass Hill](https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/lfb/bl/blfb34.htm)," a Norwegian fairy tale with an incredible
footprint of variants and stories with similar structures from all over the world.

And it's probably the most formally/grammatically strange &amp; ambitious piece I've written, which makes it all the
more exciting that more than one editor expressed their love for it&mdash;in withdrawing the story from another journal,
that editor said they adored it and hoped I'd send something else along, which I hope to do sooner rather than later.

I have to thank writer/teacher [Christina Rosso](https://christina-rosso.com/events/) for the fairy tale workshop where
this piece got its early start. I highly recommend joining one of her workshops if there's something that suits you on
the horizon!
