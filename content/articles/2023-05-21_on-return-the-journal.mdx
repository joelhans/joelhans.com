My flash fiction story, ["On Return from the Land Where One Never Dies,"](https://thejournalmag.org/archives/21817) is
live now in [issue 46.3](https://thejournalmag.org/archives/21971) of *The Journal*. I submitted to this literary
magazine a lot back in the 2013-2016 era of my writing, so it's a publication I've been after for a long time. Lovely
for it to finally happen, and for me to move something out of the [forthcoming column](/articles/a-hefty-forthcoming)
and into the published space.

It's heavily influenced by one of my favorite fairy tales of all time: "The Land Where One Never Dies," which you can
find in Italo Calvino's [*Italian
Folktales*](https://books.google.com/books?id=3Bwb6sTtLLEC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=the+land+where+one+never+dies&source=bl&ots=gT3lpTAv-N&sig=ACfU3U1EHLkmdarqmzFmKQMXHonKnPeLSw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwii1ui-wIT_AhXQI0QIHWoFDzQQ6AF6BAghEAM#v=onepage&q=the%20land%20where%20one%20never%20dies&f=false).

Think of it less as a retelling and more of an extension. What happens after a fairy tale ends? What happens when
fairy tale logic meets our world? What if the magic doesn't work the way you hoped it would?
