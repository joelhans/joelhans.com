With "nomination season" in the literary short fiction&mdash;what a truly niche-y niche that is!&mdash;world winding down, I wanted to reflect on all the unexpected love my strange little stories have been receiving from the editors who were generous to publish them in the first place.

Last year, I had 12 stories published&mdash;this alone is an incredible bounty for which I am endlessly grateful. But my thread of gratitude goes a little further back.

In 2022, I was stumbling my way back into short fiction after years of dedicating myself to a novel that has not (yet) proven itself and I have not (yet) given up on, wondering if I could ever find the magic I seemingly left behind after graduating from my MFA in 2016.

I remember rolling through this nomination season, which starts in November and stretches into January and February of the same winter, 

In early 2023, I finally felt like I was hitting my stride in writing flash and microfiction, finding voice for the themes and styles that fascinate me most. Editors were picking them up faster. I delt with less rejection. Best of all, these stories resonated more strongly than ever before with those who read them among all the other work being published online and in print regularly.

In November 2023, the folks at _Cease, Cows_ let me know they nominated my story, [&ldquo;The Earth, Measured&rdquo;](https://ceasecows.com/2023/03/16/the-earth-measured-by-joel-hans/) for _Best Microfiction_.

I figured one nomination was a fantastic signal for 



This year, my stories were nominated _eight_ times.
