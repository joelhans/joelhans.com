  My persistent list of forthcoming fiction has quieted down to a whimper. I'm more

Nearly 18 months ago, I wrote quite happily about about a [hefty
forthcoming](/articles/a-hefty-forthcoming). At the time, I had hit a wonderful
cadence&mdash;I was writing new pieces of flash weekly as part of [SmokeLong
Fitness](https://www.smokelong.com/smokelong-fitness-the-community-workshop/) (I
truly do recommend it!), and they were getting near-immediate critique from
peers, which inspired me to edit and submit with a confidence I hadn't felt
since [2014](/articles/hello-arizona).

Which, with some luck in the submission grinder, meant a persistent list of
forthcomings.

All those stories have since been published. I'm proud of each, thankful to the
editors who accepted and championed them. Astonished every time someone read and
responded to any of them. They were absolutely fruitless for my
&ldquo;career,&rdquo; but they were the best art I could make when I felt
inspired to make them, and they connected me to other writers I've since come to
admire and take inspiration from.

Community over career.

Or, to put it another way: I still write entirely for myself, not for some
perceived audience. Particularly not as an attempt at commercial success.

Now, thing have swung back to quite the opposite and I only have a single story
forthcoming&mdash;a piece of flash fiction in *Passages North*. I don't mention
this as some tragic fall from some semblance of *success*&mdash;I've admired
this journal for nearly 15 years, and seeing my name among dozens of incredible
contributors was a blast. Absolutely cannot wait to hold the issue in my hands.

I write about this quiet era of forthcoming because I've learned to be
comfortable with it. I already given myself a multi-year lull in publishing, and
when I was ready to come back into that space, my work was no less accepted and
read than it had been before. The community I'd found all the way back in the
mid-2010s persisted, and since this &ldquo;hefty forthcoming&rdquo;is out in the
world, it's gotten a bit bigger. Knowing this, the quiet becomes a much more
comfortable space.

For now, knowing how my brain operates and knowing the reasons _why_ I write
fiction at all, I'm okay with the quiet.

Quiet might kill careers, but not community.

Certainly not the art.
