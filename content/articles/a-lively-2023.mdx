My writer&rsquo;s life has started out much livlier in 2023 than last year. As of writing this on April 1, I&rsquo;ve published
three new stories:

- [&ldquo;The Earth, Measured&rdquo;](https://ceasecows.com/2023/03/16/the-earth-measured-by-joel-hans/) — _Cease, Cows_
- [&ldquo;The Times I Traded Time With the Crows&rdquo;](https://atlasandalice.com/2023/01/30/fiction-from-joel-hans/) —
_Atlas and Alice_
- [&ldquo;Feeding the Oscars&rdquo;](https://trampset.org/feeding-the-oscars-4a185c627e87) — _trampset_

And I have new stories, ones I&rsquo;m really happy with, coming in _Story_, _Pidgeonholes_, and (as of yesterday!) _The
Journal_.

All things point to some linear progression&mdash;a greater volume of publications must mean I&rsquo;m on the right track,
right? Especially if they&rsquo;re among my favorite work, the most _me_, without compromises for what people might find
&ldquo;readable&rdquo;?

But there&rsquo;s still an enormous weight of doubt.

Will I ever write a book anyone would like to read? Will an agent ever see the potential in said took? Will I ever take
any step toward being a more &ldquo;professional&rdquo; writer?

My response to that doubt has been ambition. Trying harder, submitting stories and a story collection more widely,
querying more agents, being more present and active on Twitter, engaging more with various online communities.

Last month, I burned myself out completely. It&rsquo;s not just the amount of work I did&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard to stay ambitious
when the professional publishing world gives you mostly silence in return.

Last weekend, after being inspired by [Melissa Llanes
Brownlee](https://www.melissallanesbrownlee.com/talk-story/2023/3/24/is-my-writing-life-making-me-happy), I took a break
from all writing-related work. No new words, no submissions, no query research. It was truly lovely, and at the time, I
told myself: _This should be the new normal_. Leave the weekend for life! But here we are, on April 1st, a Saturday,
looking up submission windows and trying to figure out which pieces I can finish to meet this deadline or that.

I don&rsquo;t know to care this much and turn it off that easily.
