For those who don’t know the structure of a sentence, a world without verbs is an ambiguous fortune. “Is this something
we’re for or against?”

A verb is, of course, the conveyance of action. “To do.” We run, jump, crawl, love. We abscond, congregate, pontificate.
Action is at the core of what it means to be human. By assigning our instinctual motions a specific utterance—the runs
and jumps—we give them meaning and significance. They become a part of the greater human experience. While the subject
is truly the core of a sentence—without words for you or myself, or that tree, how would I tell you that we should go
climb it?—the verb makes what we say come alive, in a sense. Any language is dead without it. Life is dead without it.

Then again, action is not a uniquely human trait. Going back to the universe’s creation itself, we have a fundamental
movement. Something expands from nothing. So we can say this dependence on action is ubiquitous; neither the universe
nor action can survive without the other. Of course, one particularly masochist writer thinks he can. In 2004, Michael
Thaler published ["Le Train de Nulle Part"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Train_de_Nulle_Part), a 233-page novel
composed entirely without verbs. Without, by extension, any semblance of action. A Wikipedia editor was so generous as
to provide a sample:

> Fool’s luck! A vacant seat, almost, in that compartment. A provisional stop, why not? So, my new address in this train
> from nowhere: car 12, 3rd compartment, from the front. Once again, why not?

It certainly feels constrained enough. What I do admire in Thaler’s attempt here is a basic capacity to convey action
without explicitly conveying any, but I still have no desire to read a novel entirely devoid of action. If action is
impossible, so is progress, and so is the building of any narrative progress, a climax, a denouement.

And what I find boldly hypocritical in Thaler’s manifesto for the novel (because who tortures themselves to write 60,000
words of inaction without an agenda?) is that he’s a crusader against the verb as a fundamental crutch for human
language. He describes his hatred for action: “The verb is like a weed in a field of flowers. You have to get rid of it
to allow the flowers to grow and flourish. Take away the verbs and the language speaks for itself.”

The blatantly irony, of course, is that he could not help but use no less than five verbs within a terse three
sentences. But to deconstruct the inanity of his statement a little more: If the elimination of verbs allows for more
“flourishing” language, how can he explain the dullness of his own work? We have a narrator who thinks only in vague
exposition and useless questions. Description of a train car hardly makes for compelling storytelling. Thaler seems to
be one of a self-replicating contingent that espouses the importance of beauty in syntax and archaic word choice over
the capacity to tell a story. When a writer’s capacity to convey a story is subjugated by his overwhelming desire to
stun the reader with frivolous wordplay, he has become nothing more than pandering jockey for his own elitism.

But one can’t stop a Frenchman from pushing his backward thoughts into a published novel. “Why not?” indeed.
