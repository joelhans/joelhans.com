In what is most likely my last veterinarian story until I turn the damn world into a novel, you can now read a story
about horses and eyeball and blood over at [_Spork
Press_](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324133111/http://sporkpress.com/?p=5077).

Many thanks to Joel Smith there for selecting the piece and being kind about my strange and grammatically-questionable
title.
