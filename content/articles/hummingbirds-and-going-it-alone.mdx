First off, some good news. A flash piece of mine, “The Hummingbird’s Anti-Torpor,” will be in the fall issue of
[Spartan](https://web.archive.org/web/20160812111944/http://spartanlit.com/). More information coming soon.

> This piece has since [been published](/articles/hummingbirds-anti-torpor-spartan)!

This piece is now the third in my veterinarians series to be accepted for publication, and with any luck, a few more
will follow in the months to come. In the meantime, I just have to keep plugging away at them. Two drafts are
in-progress, and the list of ridiculous concepts grows.

But what’s most interesting about these pieces to me is that because they’re generally shorter, and because they’re a
little on the quirky side, and because I have a very specific trajectory for each, I’ve written, edited, and submitted
them all without the usual step of having someone read/critique it. It’s been a pretty enlightening exercise, if only to
help improve my own self-editing techniques, and the ability to read a story objectively, even though I’m the one who
wrote it in the first place. And, clearly, something is working. I haven’t had this much fast-and-rejection-free success
on work in a long time.

I still have every intention on sending out longer work to my few trusted peers, but perhaps this is when I begin to
trust my own instincts a little more, and learn to draw the line more clearly when I know exactly what I’m trying to do.
Either way, it’s an exciting time.
