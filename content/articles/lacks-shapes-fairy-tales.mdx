In honor of Tell a Fairy Tale Day (Feb. 26th) I wrote an essay about my own “lacks,” and how fairy tales have helped fill them, for Alternating Current. [Go read!](https://medium.com/the-coil/our-lacks-in-the-shape-of-fairy-tales-joel-hans-39027a50fdb6#.2dvv1tkrc) It came out more personal than I intended, but it’s all good.

Thanks to Leah Angstman for giving me the space to write this. Really fun to write a piece of non-fiction.
