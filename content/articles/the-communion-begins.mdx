Autumn in Arizona inspires fall cleaning&mdash;as the heat dials back, save for direct sun in the early afternoon, and
the sky deepens to a darker blue, and as the Sonoran Desert stashes away the monsoon magic for a different flavor, I
feel an extraordinary need to clarify.

Instead of unpacking from a work trip to Detroit and shoving my suitcase back into storage, I was digging through an old
box of computer parts and nested wires that's been living in our office closet since we moved into this house nearly two
years ago.

I had already sorted through fraying headphones and ancient graphics cards and business cards from two jobs ago, thrown
away a few armfuls, and repopulated my desk with a few forgotten trinkets, when I found this note from Aurelie Sheehan,
a professor I worked with at the University of Arizona when I was getting my MFA.

>  Joel, your writing helps us see what we have become blind to. I've not seen better proof that writing is not selfish
>  or insular, but a communion of the highest order.

Aside from this being such a kind, thoughtful compliment, it's migrated back to me at such a perfect time&mdash;a moment
of transition and doubt, as I both change course and wait, somewhat patiently, for the email(s) that will change
everything. I've put the novel project&mdash;THE STAR CASSETTE&mdash;away for now, as I [wait to hear
back](/now#november-2022) on the small barrages of query emails I've been sending out, and have returned my focus to
shorter work and projects.

One of which is a series of communions between people and the animals around them.

Communion.

One of my deepest fascinations is borrowed from fairy tales&mdash;the ease by which they communicate with one another.
Not by mouth, not making human sounds, like the Disney-ified version of these ancient stories, but from a deeper source.
A telepathy. A feeling. A look in the eye and _knowing_. A language we once shared with the animals around us, but in
our search for technology and growth and the obedience of the world around us, we lost.

I wrestled with this inability to answer our animals friends through my last novel attempt, WHAT STILLS NEVER SURVIVES,
in which a veterinarian, navigating a world where animals are changed and killed through an apocalyptic event, wishes
she could understand where the animals around her hurt. Whether they wish the hurt were gone. Whether they want to be
fixed. Every time I include an animal protagonist into a story of mine, like [&ldquo;The Boomslang
Coup&rdquo;](https://mastersreview.com/new-voices/the-boomslang-coup-by-joel-hans/), I'm actively exploring that
borderline. 

The entrance to a deep and dark woods, where, upon passing through, where we might commune with the animals once again.

I have some exciting news from this border: My prose poem, &ldquo;Beneath the Undergarden&rdquo; is now live in issue 14
of [_Tiny Molecules_](https://www.tinymolecules.com/issues/fourteen#joel-hans). I'm always excited and worried in equal
measures when a new piece of mine passes the transom between my computer and the world at large, but this one is unique:
the first in what I hope will be a long series of communions.

A few are on their way later this year, like [&ldquo;Meal Prep&rdquo;](/articles/ready-for-some-meal-prep) and
&ldquo;The Reception&rdquo;with others still searching for their homes.

I'd love to use November, with NaNoWriMo and its oppositional writing challenges, as an opportunity to push this project
forward. Really bring it to life the way I had with my endlings proect from years ago.
