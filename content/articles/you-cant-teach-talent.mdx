Benjamin Percy is one of my favorite writers—I just finished reading _Red Moon_ and absolutely loved it—and now he’s laid down a great bit on the art of teaching, and what emerging writers need to focus on:

> You can’t teach talent, but you can teach people how to read strenuously and mimic the moves of rock-star writers so
> that they eventually accumulate a toolbox of skills. No different than baseball players or ballerinas or painters or
> pianists. A writing teacher is a coach. I’m forcing them to watch footage of games repeatedly. I’m adjusting their
> form. I’m showing them the way colors mix together, the way to play with light and shadow. I’m giving them exercises
> to elongate a second beat or shorten a third and create a magician’s lilt to their music. I’m yelling at them when
> they’re being lazy and whispering soothingly when they want to give up and cry and clapping them on the back when they
> finally pull off a great stunt.

I hope that when I am finally able to pursue an MFA program, I can have professors like Percy. I want someone to yell at me in a voice as amazing as his and then pat me on the back, even just once. And, maybe, that would be a good enough reason to pour a little whiskey, raise our glasses in celebration.
